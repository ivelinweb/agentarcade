## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or pnpm
- MongoDB (v4.4 or later)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivelinweb/AgentArcade.git
cd AgentArcade
```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:

```
PORT=8002
SKIP_MONGODB=false
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/agentic-eth
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8002
```

### Running the Application

1. Start MongoDB:

```bash
# Create a directory for MongoDB data (if it doesn't exist)
mkdir -p /tmp/mongodb

# Start MongoDB as a background process
mongod --dbpath /tmp/mongodb --fork --logpath /tmp/mongodb.log
```

2. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

3. In a new terminal, start the frontend server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

4. Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
